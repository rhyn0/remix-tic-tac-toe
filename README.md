# Remix Tic-Tac-Toe

Taking the [React TicTacToe Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) and gonig further with it.

## Extra Features

I tackle the **Extra Improvements** that are suggested at the end of the article.

1. For the current move only, show `You are at move #...` instead of a button.
1. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
1. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
1. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
1. Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.

## Create Remix

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

-   `build/server`
-   `build/client`
